## Summary
catwm is a very simple and lightweight tiling window manager.

## Modes
catwm allows a tiled layout with one master area and a vertical stacking area:

    --------------
    |        |___|
    |        |___|
    | Master |___|
    |        |___|
    |        |___|
    --------------

and monocle mode.

Horizontal stacking might be added in the future.

## Installation
 * Install Xlib
 * Edit `config.h`
 * Compile with `make`

## Bugs
 * Sending a window to another desktop causes the wm to crash
 * Compiler warnings
